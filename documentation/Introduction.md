Introduction
==

> Arduino is common term for a software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures computer open-source hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)

> Arduino is an open-source project founded by Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis.

## Arduino CC Projects

### Create

> We are finally ready to release create.arduino.cc, the Arduino platform that will provide the community with a more modern and flexible tool to write code, a more integrated way of accessing content and learning while doing.

## Comunity Support

### Processing

> Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

### Wiring

> Wiring is an open-source programming framework for microcontrollers.

> Wiring allows writing cross-platform software to control devices attached to a wide range of microcontroller boards to create all kinds of creative coding, interactive objects, spaces or physical experiences.
